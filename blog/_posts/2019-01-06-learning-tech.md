My 2c on how learning in Tech.

Often, leaning specific technologies are a vital part of my day-to-day job, as I've spent countless time familiarize myself with various languages, frameworks, and tools. In my way of working, without adequate knowledge of how a particular technology works, it usually leads to inability to integrate it into projects, or to initiate new projects with it.

However, what I found important in learning are not any particular tech, but transferable knowledge. People could talk about learning the next hot client-side framework, but there're a lot of similarity between them. Learning Django, for example, taught me more than just Django syntax, but lots of generic issues when developing a back-end web server, such as optimization problems, static resources problems, etc. (props to the Django's documentation teams).

Besides, learning the basis of what these technologies are based on helps tremendously in better understand how to fit this tool/framework into my projects.

The difficulty I'm usually seeing right now is not how to use certain technologies, but how to integrate different ones into on-going project, how to leverage the strength of one to aid the short coming of the other.

For instance, learning how to use CI tool is important, but the better part that I want to understand is what constitutes a CD/CI solutions, what are build servers and why do we need it. There're different services such as Travis-CI (the one I'm using for this blog), there're also open-source project (Jenkins) that we use at work; they share a lot of common attributes. Knowing tools help me evaluate when to use which, and the benefits, cost of doing so.

As talking to some of our interns, I urge them to learn the why behind the technology, not solely the particular part like syntax, or learning just enough to solve this one ticket. Leaning is time consuming and difficult, so I think these sort of things are what makes me a better learner.
