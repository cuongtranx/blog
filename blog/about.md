Working professionally as software developer in Toronto.

As I'm trying to find answers to a lot of questions I have in my life, this blog is one of the tools I'm employing.

People say that having a blog as a developer is good for your career and whatnot, but that's (at least for now) is not the thing I seek in creating a blog. What I'm hoping to achieve here is to create a space for me share my thoughts, writing, knowledge with the Internet, and later a solid proof to see my own development over the years.

At the moment of writing this, the technology I'm working with on a daily basis is Python, JavaScript and a whole bunch in between.

The text editor of choice is vim. #vimforlife
