# About Me

As of right now, I'm working as software developer based in Toronto, Canada.

The technologies I'm working with on a daily basis are Python, JavaScript and a whole bunch in between.

I enjoy reading, learning, a bit of gaming (Monster Hunter, PKM Go), cooking, and of course, drinking coffee.

The text editor of choice is Vim. #vimforlife.

# Why do I write?

As I'm trying to find answers to a lot of questions I've come across with, I found writing things to down to be one of the most useful way to record and remember those answers.

What I'm hoping to achieve here is to create a space for me record my thoughts, writing, knowledge, and anything I could think of, plus comfortable to share with the internet.
